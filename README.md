=======================================

Android
-------
This project uses the Adafruit MMA8451 breakout board connected to an Arduino Uno. The sensor and Arduino hardware can be easily modified. Eventually a custom board and enclosure should be built.

- Adafruit MMA8451 webpage:    adafru.it/2019
- Adafruit Arduino libraries:  https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mma8451-accelerometer-breakout/wiring-and-test

The Arduino code and libraries are included in the Arduino folder in this repository.
