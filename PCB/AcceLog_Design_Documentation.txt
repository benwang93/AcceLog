----------

Status to date:
- Completed AcceLog v00 board design
	- Soldered 2 boards, one working
	- Previous specs
		- 3.3V board supply
		- 16 Mhz crystal frequency
		- 150mA LDO

V01 Design:
- Hardware features
	- MicroSD card slot
	- Rechargable battery
		- Li-ion LIR2450 battery with PMIC
		- Li-ion battery options w/o PMIC
	- LED status indicators
		- Power (to microcontroller)
		- Charging
		- Recording
		- Error/status
	- Buttons
		- Start/stop recording
		- Power (sliding switch?)
	- Power supply
		- PMIC/voltage regulator 1 (to battery)
		- Voltage regulator 2 (to proc)
			- Unless PMIC contains 2nd voltage regulator
	- Processor & Oscillator
		- 2.7V - 10MHz - 0.5mA
			- This sounds like a good one to try next. Plus can run battery down to lower voltage
		- 3.3V - 16MHz - 1-1.5mA
			- Previous design
		- Looking into using ATmega 32u4 for USB capabilities
			- For 3.3V/2.7V board, have to step down 5V VBUS to 3.3V/2.7V, but still route VBUS into the USB part of chip
			- This will eliminate need for FTDI. Maybe not more expensive in the end
	- USB
		- PC detection:
			- 5V line to digital input
			- FTDI maybe has pin for connected?
		- Can still use FT232, however no USB mass storage
		- Mass storage option would require something like ATMEGA16u2, however, no Arduino support...
- Software features
	- MicroSD appear over USB?
	- FAT or exFAT filesystem
		- FAT would only work for files up to 4GB. Might be an issue depending on recording length. This doesn't influence hardware design though
- Hardware implementation
	- MicroSD
		- Push-pull type socket

- Tasks:
	- Hardware
		- Design MicroSD footprint
		- Add switches
		- Add power supply
	- Software
		- How to change Atmega328's frequency (burn fuse?)
